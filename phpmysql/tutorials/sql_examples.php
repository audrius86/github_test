 * Note: A NULL value is different from a zero value or a field that contains spaces. A field with a NULL value is one that has been left blank during record creation!
 *
 * We will have to use the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators instead.

 * SELECT column_names FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NULL;
 * SELECT column_names FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;
